## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I'm **Biswajit Kabi**, a curious and creative full-stack developer currently pursuing Computer Science at Jaypee University of Engineering and Technology. I specialize in building responsive, performant web applications and have a particular passion for crafting scalable systems.

💡 I love solving complex problems—whether it's through **Java & SpringBoot** on the backend or creating delightful experiences with **React & Next.js** on the frontend.  
🚀 When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me competing in LeetCode contests, diving into a new tech framework, or mentoring peers in developer communities.

 I build web apps the way Tony Stark builds suits – functional, sleek, and a bit of flair.

I'm always up for a new challenge or collaboration. Let’s connect!
